# App Templates

This repository hosts the official templates (**'Apps Templates'**) definitions for Portainer.

For more information about the template definition format and how to deploy your own templates, see the [relevant documentation section](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/templates/deploy_stack/).

## Notice

Since version 3 of the templates, we've moved to use `main` branch as the default branch for this repository. If you are using version 2, please use the `master` branch of this repository (or https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portainer/templates/master/templates-2.0.json).
